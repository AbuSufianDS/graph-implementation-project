## 📋 Overview
A complete implementation of directed graphs with adjacency list representation and topological sort algorithms in C. This project demonstrates graph theory concepts with practical implementations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler
- Make
- Git

## Features
1. Adjacency list representation of directed graphs
2. Graph construction from adjacency matrix
3. Graph printing function (`printGraph()`)
4. Two topological sort implementations:
   - Using adjacency matrix
   - Using adjacency linked lists
5. Queue data structure for Kahn's algorithm

## Compilation & Execution
```bash

### Installation & Running
```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AbuSufianDS/graph-implementation-project.git
cd graph-implementation-project

# 2. Compile the project
make

# 3. Run the program
./graph_program

# 4. Clean build files (optional)
make clean
